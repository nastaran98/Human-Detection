# Human-Detection

In this work, human detection task is done using different versions of YOLO algorithm. <br />
The code and output video for each algorithm is in the corresponding folder. <br />
The best results are achieved by YOLOv8.<br />
For adding unique id to detected objects, we use supervision library and its utils. The results are in "YOLOv8 + ID assignment" folder. <br />
