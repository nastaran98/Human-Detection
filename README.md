# Human-Detection

In this work, human detection task is done using different versions of YOLO algorithm. The code and output video for each algorithm is in the corresponding folder.
The best results are achieved by YOLOv8.
For adding unique id to detected objects, we use supervision library and its utils. The results are in "YOLOv8 + ID assignment" folder.
